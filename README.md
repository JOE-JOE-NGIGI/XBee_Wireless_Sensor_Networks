This repository consists of the sensor nodes code. The web application
code is not hosted on this repository.

STM32F103C8T6 Microcontroller Boards have been used for the sensor nodes.
A NodeMCU S32 (ESP-32) microcontroller has been configured as the coordinator node.

AM2303 Temperature Humidity Sensors have been used to collect temperature and humidity data.
